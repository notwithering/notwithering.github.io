                    Haven't written a post in a while. Firstly, hope you have a
                    merry Christmas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This will be a short little post, probably not even any
                    section titles, but I just want to say... there's no more
                    JavaScript on this website! Yay! In
                    <a href="/blog/you-like-my-website/">a previous post</a> I
                    said, "I am sure that the blinking underscore can completely
                    be redone in CSS, but I am too down syndromed to research
                    how to do it". This is me talking about the blinking cursor
                    on the header of this website next to "withering@away ~ $".
                    Well, I researched how to do it, and now this website is
                    fully JavaScript free! Yay!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll take this time to talk about something I would LOVE
                    from vanilla HTML. If you looked at the source code of this
                    website, it'd feel like you just gave the Sandman a blowjob
                    from how
                    <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself"
                        >DRY</a
                    >
                    it looks, everything is repeated in each HTML file. What
                    would be nice is if you could source HTML files similar to
                    how you can source JavaScript files from script tags, for
                    example:
                    <code
                        >&#60;header
                        src="header.html"&#62;&#60;/header&#62;</code
                    >, like that'd be sick if I didn't have to copy and paste my
                    giant header in every HTML file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anywho, that's all I needed to say, hope you have a holly
                    jolly Christmas and a happy New Years.
                </p>
