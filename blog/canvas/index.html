                    is a command-line application to view images inside the
                    terminal. This small program uses a very clever technique to
                    still display images even when the terminal doesn't support
                    image display.

                <strong>What is subcharacter-layering?</strong>

                    The way it's able to do this is by using ANSI escape codes
                    along with Half Block characters. Viu uses the Lower Half
                    Block unicode character (U+2584 "â–„") with 2 ANSI escape
                    codes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program takes the first pixel of the image and sets its
                    color as the background color then takes the pixel color
                    directly below it and sets that as the foreground color.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ANSI takes the Lower Half Block character and sets the
                    background color of it to the top pixel color of the pair.
                    ANSI then takes the foreground color and sets the color of
                    the character to the foreground color which is set to be the
                    bottom pixel color of the pair. Think of it as drawing a
                    rectangle of the top pixel color and drawing a square of the
                    bottom pixel color over it. The rectangle being the
                    background color while the square is the Lower Half Block
                    character.

                <strong>What is this package I'm developing?</strong>

                    is a package for go that I am currently developing. This
                    package at the time of writing this provides multiple
                    functions and types to help you implement
                    subcharacter-layering. It provides functions to create
                    canvases, fill canvases, render a canvas, and convert an
                    image to a canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What types of subcharacter-layering does it support? The
                    package is still in it's very early stages of development so
                    it can only use half block subcharacter-layering. I am very
                    excited to add sextant subcharacter-layering which uses
                    sextant blocks (eg. ðŸ¬¥ðŸ¬”) which will provide 4 more pixels
                    than half block subcharacter-layering and 6 more than plain
                    2 character-wide pixels while being thinner.
