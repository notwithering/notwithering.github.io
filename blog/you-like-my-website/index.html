		<h3>
			<p>
				Say, do you like my website? I take pride in this specific website, it's beautiful (to me). Of course,
				I'm a no-life Arch addict that spends his time playing with computers. But I just want to share with you
				my website design.
			</p>
		</h3>

		<h2 class="title"><strong>Colors</strong></h2>
		<h3>
			<p>
				My website uses VGA standard 4-bit colors defined <a
					href="https://www.phatcode.net/res/221/files/vbe20.pdf">here</a>. Arguably, I believe the VGA
				standard for 4-bit colors is the most beautiful color scheme I have ever witnessed, but of course,
				Gruvbox is second on the list.
			</p>
		</h3>

		<h2 class="title"><strong>Layout</strong></h2>
		<h3>
			<p>
				The layout of my website is meant to be close to emulating the way a tty looks, but steering away in
				some parts to provide a cooler look. As you can tell, some text is larger to pronounce it's dominance,
				such as the titles.
			</p>

			<p>
				Some things are even more pronounced such as the article title as it uses the class "hlWhite" which
				stands for highlight white. All it does is invert the color by changing the background-color to white
				and the foreground color to the --background-color variable (black as of writing this).
			</p>
		</h3>

		<h2 class="title"><strong>JavaScript</strong></h2>
		<h3>
			<p>
				The only JavaScript that is on this website is for the blinking underscore on the logo at the top left.
				JavaScript is absolutely not required for my website to work. Content should be free to use without and
				risk of tracking. I am sure that the blinking underscore can completely be redone in CSS, but I am too
				down syndromed to research how to do it.
			</p>
		</h3>

		<h2 class="title"><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2>
		<h3>
			<p>
				This was a shorter article than usual, probably because there's barely anything to my website. I kinda'
				just felt like writing an article for no reason. I also apologize to the one person reading this for not
				writing anything for 3 months. Something I noticed was that I write an article on around the same day.
				Nov 19 > Dec 18 > Feb 18, but I broke the cycle with this one.
			</p>

			<p>
				Anywho, source code is available on my Github under <a
					href="https://github.com/notwithering/notwithering.github.io">this repo</a>. And obviously as the
				low-life Arch Linux eliteist I am. I am required to post a screenshot of my hurrendous abomination of
				Breeze plus Gruvbox combination of a desktop.
			</p>
