            <h2 class="title"><strong>Uncreative Color Schemes</strong></h2>
            <h3>
                <p>
                    A normal screen using 8-bit RGB color can display 16,777,216
                    colors, yet color scheme enthusiasts manage to choose the
                    shittiest possible color. They then just make 20 different
                    random shades of that color and there they have a so called
                    color scheme.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From what I counted on
                    <a href="https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/">Goph</a>, 32 out
                    of 254 themes were <strong>not</strong> a shade of either
                    black or blue. That means ~87% of all the themes on that
                    site had a background color of either black or blue. Come
                    on, have some creativity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think schemes need to be more like Red Alert, Mono Green,
                    Grass, and Fairy Floss. The creators actually had the balls
                    to make something that pops out. Even something like Blue
                    Dolphin isn't apart of the black and blue hivemind, even
                    though it is blue, but because it actually tries to be
                    different with it's shade!

            <h2 class="title"><strong>Bad Color Schemes</strong></h2>
            <h3>
                <p>
                    I'm not saying these are bad color schemes, but when I was
                    looking through Goph I saw the Base2Tone schemes. I attached
                    an example below, who are these for?
                </p>
                <img src="base2tone.png" , width="500px" />
                <p>
                    Back on topic, when I look at Solarized Dark it's like I'm
                    taking a plasma cutter to my eyes. Honestly, I will say
                    though, Solarized Light is better than I would expect if all
                    I saw was Solarized Dark. The main thing I hate is that in
                    Solarized Dark, 3 colors and 1 almost unnoticeable color
                    have another high shade while all others don't. Solarized
                    Light also has 4 high shades and all the others have the
                    same shade. It's a mess.

            <h2 class="title"><strong>Monakai</strong></h2>
            <h3>
                <p>
                    Take what I just said about uncreative and bad color
                    schemes---and throw it out, grab your card and purchase a
                    license for it now. Monakai is a color scheme that does
                    everything wrong by being uncreative, and looking
                    hurrendous, and then having you purchase a â‚¬12.50 ($13.84)
                    license to use it. You really need to pirate color schemes
                    now?
                </p>
                <img
                    src="https://monokai.pro/assets/images/b676d8e810db2179.jpg"
                    width="750px"
                />
                <p>
                    This is the only one of 6 themes that Monakai provided that
                    didn't look shit. It's a decent theme, not worth 14 bucks.

                    In conclusion, use whatever you like. Even if it's blue,
                    black, gay rainbow unicorn, I don't care.
